# Graph-InfoClust-GIC
Graph InfoClust: Leveraging cluster-level node information for unsupervised graph representation learning
https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06946

Unsupervised graph representation learning method (under review)

## gic-dgl
GIC (node classification task) implemented in Deep Graph Library (DGL), which should be installed

## GIC
GIC (link prediction, clustering, and visualization tasks) based on Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) original implementation.
